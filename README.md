# Calculator-Project
Calculator Unit Test Starter Code


1.	Set Up Your Environment:
o	Clone/download the starter calculator project.
o	Import the project into your chosen IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code) 
2.	Review the Calculator Class:
o	Examine the code in Calculator.java to understand what each method does.
o	Note that the divide() method throws an exception if the divisor is zero.
3.	Write Unit Tests:
o	Open the CalculatorTest.java file in the test folder.
o	Complete any missing test methods or add additional tests if you wish.
o	Use the JUnit 5 assertions (assertEquals, assertThrows, etc.) to verify the expected behaviour of each method.
o	Ensure that each test method is annotated with @Test.
4.	Run Your Tests:
o	Use your IDEâ€™s test runner.
o	In VS Code you will need to install the extension: Test Runner for Java
This will give you a testing icon: 

o	Verify that all tests pass successfully. If any test fails, review your implementation in the Calculator class and your test cases.
5.	Extra Challenge (Optional):
o	Add some more methods to Calculator.java 
o	Add the corresponding Tests
